# Virtual-Mouse-2.0

# SUPER SMOOTH

# The story
Around october 2021, I got the idea to create a virtual mouse from the idea of Iron Man. Is it possible?
Maybe? So I tried to create a program that You can control with your finger and not touching the screen or even the mouse at all!
First, it was hard. With little knowledge of OpenCv and Computer Vision, I was struggling. Luckily, My older brother is good at this.
He have created a program(Link: https://github.com/Pyae-Sone-Nyo-Hmine) that can track your hand/finger. 
I ask him if I can use some of his hand tracking algorithms. He said Maybe.I used the code and implement it in my program. But even if it works, it cannot move the mouse.
I learned about pyautogui(https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and it was great.
Combining those two and after many MANY debugging, it works but with a catch, lagging. I put it in github
After nearly half a year, I learned many things. I even created my own virtual assisstant. Again link: https://github.com/Ye-Yint-Nyo-Hmine/Virtual-Assistant
I got the idea on improving the virtual mouse. And I did it! With some threading in python, it is very smooth!
This is great cause I am bad at patching glitches. 


# What it does
This program helps you to control and click your mouse by not touching any keys!!
Just like in Iron Man, Tony Stark uses his hand to control things virtually.
It do the same thing with your mouse.

# Steps
Put the position of your hand with the index finger being at the top like when you count to one.
Then, move your index finger to move the mouse.
To click, you need to take out your middle finger like when you count two.
This might be difficult to do but you will get used to it.
